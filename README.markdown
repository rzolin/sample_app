# Test Application to test Ruby on Rails

[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/) is used as the basis to create the app.

In addition to the tutorial steps I've added [compass](http://compass-style.org/) and 
[haml](http://haml-lang.com) support in this app. The HTML and CSS files will be written
or converted using the mentioned technologies/frameworks.
